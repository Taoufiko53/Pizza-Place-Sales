# Pizza-Place-Sales
Power BI Data Analytics Project – Cleaning and Dashboarding

## Project Overview  
This is a Data Analytics project built with **Microsoft Power BI**. The purpose is to demonstrate my ability to:  

- Clean and prepare raw sales data  
- Create calculated measures (DAX)  
- Build a dynamic and interactive dashboard  
- Deliver insights to support business decisions  

==> This project focuses on **business insights and dashboarding** rather than predictive analytics.

## About the Data  
The dataset represents one year of sales from a fictitious pizza place. It includes:  

- Order date and time  
- Order details (pizza type, category, size, quantity)  
- Pricing information  

**Data Source:**  
[Pizza Place Sales – Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground/pizza-place-sales?page=2)  

Raw Data Challenges:  
- Large transaction-level dataset  
- No aggregated metrics (needed custom measures in Power BI)  
- Different pizza categories and sizes with varying revenue impact  

Cleaned & Enriched:  
- Created calculated columns and DAX measures (Revenue, Total Orders, Average Order Value)  
- Time intelligence functions (sales by day, week, month)  
- Data modeling for relationships between orders, details, and products
